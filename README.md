Install Manopt
1.Either git-clone or unzip the whole manopt directory you just downloaded in a location of your choice, say, in /my/directory/.
2.Go to /my/directory/manopt/ at the Matlab prompt and execute importmanopt.
3.You will be asked whether you want to save this path for your next Matlab sessions. If you reply Y (yes) and you have the rights to run savepath, then you won’t need to go through these steps next time you open Matlab.
